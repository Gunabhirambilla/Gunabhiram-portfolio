# Building a Reconciliation Framework Across CRM, Billing, and Operational Systems

## 📌 Background
When customer data is scattered across systems, it’s easy for billing to misalign with usage—or for records to be outdated. I built a reconciliation framework to identify mismatches across CRM, billing, and operational systems monthly.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **SQL (Snowflake)** – for extraction and comparison logic  
- **Excel** – for surfacing flagged mismatches  
- **CRM / Billing / Ops logs** – as source systems  
- **Python (optional)** – for formatting and scheduling

---

## ⚙️ What I Built

### Step 1: Identify Match Keys
Used common fields like:
- Customer ID or cleaned name
- Provider count
- Go-live status
- Active product flags

### Step 2: Normalize Data
- Removed whitespace and case mismatches across systems  
- Applied mappings for known field mismatches (e.g., legacy customer names)  
- Handled NULL values, inconsistent date formats, and duplicate entries  
- Standardized provider and location references  

### Step 3: Reconciliation Logic
- Compared provider counts and active status across CRM, billing, and operations  
- Flagged mismatches in billing vs. actual usage  
- Categorized discrepancies such as:  
  - Missing from CRM  
  - Overbilled or underbilled  
  - Usage with no corresponding billing  

### Step 4: Generate Monthly Reconciliation Report
- Compared CRM, billing, and operational data for each active customer  
- Flagged mismatches in provider count, go-live status, and product usage  
- Assigned status labels such as “Billing mismatch” or “Missing from CRM”  
- Exported the results into a monthly CSV report for Operations and Finance review

## 🧠 Results

| Metric                       | Value       |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| Mismatches flagged monthly   | 35–60       |
| Billing errors caught early  | $100s/month |
| Reconciliation time saved    | ~6 hours    |

## ✨ Key Takeaways
- Cross-system reconciliation improves data trust and financial accuracy  
- Regular audits prevent late-cycle invoice corrections  
- Structured comparison logic helps surface trends and recurring issues

## 📁 What’s Next
- Add Slack/email alerts for new mismatches  
- Log historical mismatch trends over time  
- Extend reconciliation to product usage vs. entitlement coverage
