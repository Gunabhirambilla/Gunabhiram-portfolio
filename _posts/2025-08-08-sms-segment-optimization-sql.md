# Reducing SMS Message Segments to Save $$$ — A SQL Optimization Story

## 📌 Background
SMS providers often charge based on the number of 160-character message segments. Even a few extra characters can result in double or triple the cost. I worked on analyzing SMS data and optimizing templates to reduce segment counts and save messaging costs at scale.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **SQL** – for querying and analyzing SMS length patterns  
- **Excel** – for stakeholder-friendly visualization and auditing  
- **Python (optional)** – for message simulation and template optimization  
- **CRM / Message Logs** – for source data

---

## ⚙️ What I Built

### Step 1: Extract SMS Data
Queried the messaging database to pull:
- SMS body content
- Character length of each message
- Segment count estimate (`CEILING(LENGTH(message) / 160)`)

### Step 2: Analyze Segment Overuse
Identified:
- Messages exceeding 160 characters
- High-frequency templates with 2+ segments
- Customer IDs and message types with the most overages

### Step 3: Optimize Templates
Created a SQL+Excel report to:
- Highlight messages with long intro texts, names, or URLs
- Recommend formatting changes (e.g., “Hi [Name], Your appointment is...” → “Reminder: Appt on...”)
- Reserve character space for personalization without overflow

### Step 4: Save Costs
After review, updated default templates and message logic:
- Capped message bodies at ~140–150 characters to leave space for first names
- Removed redundant phrasing or full URLs (used shortened or branded terms)

## 🧠 Results

| Metric                  | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Avg. segments/message   | 1.7                 | 1.1                |
| Over-segmented messages | 68%                 | 22%                |
| Cost per 1,000 messages | ~$15                | ~$9                |

## ✨ Key Takeaways
- Even small text optimizations can significantly reduce messaging costs
- SQL-based audits help expose hidden inefficiencies at scale
- Template redesign must balance clarity, personalization, and size

---

## 📁 What’s Next
- Build a real-time message simulator for template testing
- Add automated segment alerts for message drafts
- Integrate message length scoring in CRM or campaign tools
