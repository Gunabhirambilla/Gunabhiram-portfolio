## 👋 About Me {#about}

I design and build **scalable data systems, automated reporting pipelines, and operational analytics frameworks** that support revenue, efficiency, and decision-making.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **Data Engineering** – Snowflake data warehousing, SQL modeling, incremental pipelines  
- **Analytics Engineering** – Semantic layers, KPI frameworks, governed reporting systems  
- **Operational Analytics** – Funnel analysis, provider productivity, billing accuracy  
- **Business Impact** – ROI modeling, cost optimization, cross-system reconciliation  

I collaborate across Product, Engineering, Finance, Sales, and Customer Success to turn fragmented operational data into reliable, decision-ready systems.

## ⭐ Featured Projects {#projects}

Below are selected projects demonstrating end-to-end data system design — from modeling and automation to measurable business impact.

---

### 1. Automated KPI Reporting Pipeline (Snowflake → Python → Word/PDF)

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL, Python, Excel, Word, PDF  

- Built a fully automated reporting system extracting KPIs via parameterized SQL  
- Populated Excel templates and dynamic charts programmatically  
- Injected metrics and visuals into structured Word reports  
- Exported finalized documents as PDF for leadership distribution  
- Designed for scheduling and reuse across multiple customers  

**Impact**: ~80% reduction in manual reporting time and consistent, standardized weekly insights.

---

### 2. Customer ROI Metrics Engine (Product-Level ROI)

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL, Excel  

- Designed a standardized ROI framework across products  
- Modeled intake completion, scheduling adoption, reminder effectiveness, and engagement metrics  
- Quantified time savings, product adoption, and revenue impact potential  

**Impact**: Enabled structured renewal and upsell discussions backed by measurable product value.

---

### 3. SMS Reminder Optimization & Phone Number Rationalization

**Tech Stack**: SQL, Excel  

- Audited message content and SMS segment usage  
- Standardized templates with a ~150-character optimization threshold  
- Identified and disabled 300+ inactive or unnecessary phone numbers  

**Impact**: Reduced monthly SMS costs and improved messaging consistency.

---

### 4. Provider Count & Billing Reconciliation System

**Tech Stack**: SQL, Excel, QuickBooks  

- Built a reconciliation workflow aligning operational provider counts with CRM contracts and billing records  
- Implemented classification logic and FTE thresholds for billing alignment  
- Standardized reconciliation checkpoints across systems  

**Impact**: Improved billing accuracy and reduced risk of underbilling or misclassification.

---

### 5. EMR API Usage & Cost Analysis

**Tech Stack**: SQL, API Logs  

- Analyzed six months of API usage across multiple systems  
- Identified high-volume endpoints and redundant call patterns  
- Proposed optimization opportunities for improved cost efficiency  

**Impact**: Supported engineering decision-making and API cost governance.

---

### 6. Multi-Tenant Data Warehouse Modeling (Fact & Dimension Architecture)

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL  

- Designed scalable fact and dimension models supporting multi-customer analytics  
- Implemented time-aware joins (SCD Type 1 / Type 2 patterns) for historical attribution  
- Structured layered transformations (staging → intermediate → mart)  
- Enforced tenant-aware modeling discipline for secure benchmarking  

**Impact**: Improved query performance, reduced redundancy, and strengthened governance.

---

### 7. Idempotent Incremental ETL Framework

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL, Python  

- Designed incremental loads with deterministic watermark tracking  
- Implemented merge-based upsert logic for safe reruns  
- Built validation checks for duplicates and late-arriving data  
- Structured control tables to track pipeline state and recovery checkpoints  

**Impact**: Increased reliability of daily pipelines and reduced recovery time.

---

### 8. Cross-System Data Quality & Reconciliation Framework

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL  

- Built automated validation logic across CRM, billing, and operational systems  
- Implemented deterministic mismatch detection rules  
- Generated daily reconciliation snapshots to monitor system drift  
- Created structured exception reporting views  

**Impact**: Improved trust in financial and operational reporting.

---

### 9. Snowflake Warehouse Cost & Query Optimization Initiative

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL  

- Analyzed warehouse metering and query history to identify cost inefficiencies  
- Segmented compute by workload type (ETL, BI, ad hoc)  
- Optimized filtering and aggregation strategies to reduce full scans  
- Implemented right-sizing and auto-suspend policies  

**Impact**: Improved compute efficiency and long-term cost predictability.
