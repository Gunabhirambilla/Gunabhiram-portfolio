## 👋 About Me

I’m a data engineer and analytics specialist who builds **scalable data systems, automated reporting pipelines, and operational analytics** for healthcare organizations.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **Data Engineering** – Snowflake data warehousing, SQL modeling, automation  
- **Operational Analytics** – KPIs, funnel analysis, provider productivity, billing accuracy  
- **Business Impact** – Intake completion, scheduling conversion, ROI modeling, cost optimization  

I partner with Product, Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Customer Success to turn messy, fragmented data into systems that directly support revenue, efficiency, and decision-making.

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my **Python + Snowflake** stack to build end-to-end production-quality data pipelines.

## ⭐ Featured Projects

Below are selected projects framed as **end-to-end data and analytics systems** with clear technical scope and business impact.

---

### 1. Automated KPI Reporting Pipeline (Snowflake → Python → Word/PDF)

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL, Python, Excel, Word, PDF  

- Built an end-to-end reporting system that:
  - Extracts KPIs from Snowflake using parameterized SQL
  - Populates Excel templates and charts
  - Injects metrics and visuals into a Word report
  - Exports final reports as PDF
- Designed the workflow so it can be scheduled and reused across multiple customers.  
- **Impact**: ~80% reduction in manual reporting time and consistent weekly insights for leadership.

---

### 2. Customer ROI Metrics Engine (Product-Level ROI for Intake, Scheduling, Reminders)

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL, Excel  

- Designed a standardized ROI framework across Yosi products:
  - Intake completion vs visits
  - Self-scheduling adoption and after-hours bookings
  - Reminder effectiveness and message delivery
- Modeled product usage data to quantify time savings, adoption, and potential revenue impact.  
- **Impact**: Used in renewal and upsell conversations to show clear value by customer and product.

---

### 3. SMS Reminder Optimization & Phone Number Rationalization

**Tech Stack**: SQL, Excel  

- Audited SMS reminder content and segment usage at the customer level.  
- Defined message templates with a ~150-character cap to minimize multi-segment texts.  
- Identified and disabled 300+ inactive or unnecessary phone numbers.  
- **Impact**: Reduced monthly SMS costs (~$75/month) and standardized messaging behavior across customers.

---

### 4. Self-Scheduling Funnel Drop-Off Analytics

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL, Excel  

- Modeled the patient self-scheduling funnel:
  - Link clicks → qualification → location selection → slot selection → confirmed booking  
- Calculated stage-wise drop-off percentages and segmented results by location and time period.  
- Collaborated with product and CS to interpret where patients were abandoning the flow.  
- **Impact**: Provided concrete guidance for UX and workflow improvements to increase booking conversion.

---

### 5. Provider Count & Billing Reconciliation System

**Tech Stack**: SQL, Excel, QuickBooks  

- Built a reconciliation workflow to align:
  - Provider counts in internal operational records
  - CRM/contract details
  - QuickBooks invoices  
- Implemented business rules such as:
  - MD vs. Midlevel classification
  - FTE thresholds (e.g., >100 hours = 1.0 FTE; <100 hours = 0.5 FTE)  
- **Impact**: Improved billing accuracy and reduced risk of underbilling or misclassification.

---

### 6. Athena API Usage & Cost Analysis

**Tech Stack**: SQL, API Logs  

- Analyzed 6 months of Athena API usage across multiple customers.  
- Identified high-volume endpoints, redundant patterns, and underutilized APIs.  
- Recommended optimization opportunities for call patterns and cost reduction.  
- **Impact**: Provided engineering and leadership with data to tune API usage and manage AWS spend.

---

### 7. Intake Completion vs. Visit Ratio Engine

**Tech Stack**: Snowflake, SQL, Excel  

- Built comparative views of:
  - Intake invitations sent vs. completed forms
  - Completed forms vs. actual patient visits  
- Segmented results by customer, location, and month to identify underperforming sites.  
- **Impact**: Enabled customer success and product teams to drive digital adoption where completion lagged behind visit volume.
