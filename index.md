## 👋 About Me

I’m a data engineer and analytics specialist who builds **scalable data systems, automated reporting pipelines, and operational analytics** for healthcare organizations.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- **Data Engineering** – Snowflake data warehousing, SQL modeling, automation  
- **Operational Analytics** – KPIs, funnel analysis, provider productivity, billing accuracy  
- **Business Impact** – Intake completion, scheduling conversion, ROI modeling, cost optimization  

I partner with Product, Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Customer Success to turn messy, fragmented data into systems that directly support revenue, efficiency, and decision-making.

Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my **Python + Snowflake** stack to build end-to-end production-quality data pipelines.
